My approach for completing the code challenge was based on solving the functionality first, I did first a basic assessment of the requirements then with pseudo code I envisioned how the quiz would behave following the instructions provided, I proceeded with the HTML file, then on a separate Javascript file I integrated the functions and then I proceeded with the CSS, I used some of the colors that are present on zipdev.co


Thank you!
